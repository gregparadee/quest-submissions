## Chapter 1

### Day 1

1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 

A: The Blockchain is a large, public/open, distributed database or ledger that stores information. Databases typically store their information in tables, where a Blockchain stores its informaton in Blocks. Blocks have storage limitations and once full it is considered completed and becomes part of the timeline. A new Block is then created and new data is stored there until that block is full and then becomes part of the timeline. The blocks are linked together once a new one is created hence the term "blockchain".

2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. 

A: Smart contracts are just programs designed to interact with a Blockchain. They typically contrain scripts and functions that are called by users. They are usually used by other languages like Javascript/Python to create a DApp and make the interactions easy for users. 

3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

A: A script, reads data from a Blockchain and does not have any cost associated to it. A transaction, interacts with a Blockchain and changes data. Transactions typically have a cost associated with them. 

### Day 2

1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

A: Safety and Security, Clarity, Approachability, Developer Experience, Resource Oriented Programming

2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful?

A: Safety and Security - Protects, assuming no bad intent, the end-user and developer while encouraging mass adoption. Safety and Security are always at the top of peoples minds, especially when dealing with money or goods. Clarity - Allows someone with a little but of programming knowledge to understand what they are doing and also makes it easy for new developers to learn the language, increasing adoption. Approachability - Makes it easy to learn for the first time or switch over too if already a developer. Code should be easy, not hard. Developer Experience - Making things easy to understand and develop keeps Developers happy and motivated. Poor error handling can be a turn-off to many developers.
